- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ashrafkaka
- My name is Dr. Ashraf Kak, from Egypt, and I bring over 15 years of experience in Quality Assurance and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). I specialize in the development and implementation of Integrated Management Systems, including Quality Management Systems (QMS) and Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (OHSMS). I played a pivotal role in developing NPPA's Integrated Management System, which integrates both QMS and OHSMS.

I am a certified Lead Auditor by IRCA for ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018, with extensive experience in conducting internal and external audits, both nationally and internationally. I hold a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from Ain Shams University and a diploma in OSHA standards and their application. Currently, I serve as the General Manager of Occupational Health and Safety at the Nuclear Power Plants Authority (NPPA).

In addition, I have delivered numerous training programs, including Training of Trainers, OHS management system requirements based on OSHA, and ISO 45001:2018. I have also conducted many Quality Management training courses based on ISO 9001 and IAEA standards. I have developed various documents such as manuals, procedures, plans, and programs based on ISO 9001, ISO 45001, and ISO 14001.

I possess deep knowledge of various software tools, including Microsoft Office, MATLAB, Six Sigma, Mathcad, Root Cause Analysis, Fishbone Diagrams, Cause and Effect Analysis, Minitab, Strategic Planning, and SWOT analysis. Furthermore, I have conducted numerous OHS training sessions on topics such as work permits, working at height, confined spaces, excavation, loading and unloading, hot and cold works, and more.
